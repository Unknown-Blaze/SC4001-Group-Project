She is insufferably sweet, eternally turning cheeks, and almost totally incapable of speaking her mind if she is in disagreement with others. In short...she is the ultimate in \"goodness.\" It felt plastic to me.For whatever criticisms I have of Fanny Price, I cannot deny that the reader is forced, throughout the novel, to wish her well. I truly yearned with my full heart for Fanny to get the life and love and attention that she so heartily deserved.The story, though not as funny as Pride & Prejudice, is quite entertaining with little twists in the plot that one doesn't necessarily see coming and with an ending that really could've gone either way.I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'll probably read it again, and I would definitely recommend it to any true Austen fan.",

Everything is touched upon; from the provenance of ideas, to the actual writing (grammar, techniques, and dos and don'ts), selling, publishing, revising, finding an agent... You get it all in this book.This wonderful book answered all the questions I had about the process of writing horror, and I'm sure it will do the same for any aspiring writer. It is a great reference book that any writer should keep close to his/her writing desk, as you'll keep coming back to it whenever you have a question that needs answering.",

I can only assume that there was conflict or poor planning between Gibson & Sterling. The characters were boring and there were many pages and even chapters that could have been ripped out without anyone noticing. The plot sputtered through the whole novel and eventually just died about 50 pages from the end. Overall it was confusing and unfulfilling, and I felt that the unique setting and story idea was wasted on a failed collaboration between two writers that are used to being on their own.",

The bad parts are the story it's very short only 77 min, there is no point to the story and it's very lacluster, the voices are also very dull and have no life to them.

Lost Light is a very well written mystery, the main character is one of the best developed and multi-dimensional to be featured in a mystery series, and the plot is complex and keeps you guessing. However, on a comparative basis, Lost Light is more slow paced and less action-packed and suspenseful. Perhaps Bosch's now being a private eye versus a cop has made it seem to me that he doesn't have the same toughness and \"edge\" that made him such a memorable character in earlier books in the series. It will be interesting to see what direction Connelly takes Bosch in upcoming books. If you read this book you'll see that Connelly has created several options for Bosch. I'll be anxious to travel along with Bosch (and some other characters Connelly has featured in other books) in his next adventure, The Narrows, which will be released soon.",

We found this one on Amazon and ordered it with a bit of hesitation since we had never actually seen one all put together and working. It had very positive reviews, though, so we took a chance and ordered it. My father-in-law could not be more pleased! He was able to put it together easily and it produced delicious popcorn immediately! It was a huge hit as a gift; something he always wanted. The price was very reasonable, we felt, and the free shipping was a bonus. A well-priced, attractive, functional item from which I'm sure he'll get years of enjoyment. It is a real conversation piece in his home.",

I thought it was overlong and I was not impressed overall especially with the ending.Not only has this author shunned and insulted all of Oprah's reading fans, his novel has now turned me off as well.",

Far more then any other camera I've used. There is a red-eye flash setting, but it is manual and not very effective.

The end result is a mishmash and probably a serious copyright violation. If you want a much more in depth film about the subject, go to the source film for this cheaply made mashup.",

It's true that his views may at sometimes be a little extreme, especially those concerning the ACLU, he does offer evidence, often anecdotal to support his claims.After reading just a few chapters I remember wanting to hear the author behind the text. So I listened to his radio talk show that comes on late at night. And from listening to him provide commentary on the Iraq war, for example, you really do hear the intensity in his voice, the same passion that you find in his book. Behind every politically charged statement is not a frail writer who masks himself behind his words, but a bold, fearless savage man (!) who makes weapons out of his words.As a whole, this book shed light on issues that I had never would have looked at in the Savage way. Although it's been about two months since I've read the book I'll never forget Savage's views on the radical left.",

I have a great crib from USA baby and I noticed how the first review stated that she didn't buy the super expensive mattress from USA Baby (160.00) which I did for my first baby and it was great. It was a super snug fit in the crib and now in her toddler bed it still is a perfect fit. I decided that for this baby I didn't want to spend as much for a mattress because it did seem silly. HOWEVER, this mattress didn't fit snug in my crib nor did it have the firm feel. This is a medium quality mattress for a medium price. I bought it yesterday and took it back today. I am going to go with the expensive mattress that I know fits and is perfect for long term use.",

Walker sings beautifully as always, and as in his own compositions manages to find enough ironic counterpoint in the material to offset and thus redeem the sometimes bombastic arrangements behind him.

I would like to see a book that looks at wealthy people from every segment of society and every economic background. This book is written for middle to upper middle class white college educated people who perhaps have money problems. I strongly suspect the author has little use for any other kind of people hence the pejorative \"economic dropout\". If the potential reader fits the above described profile and wants to get married then this book might be a good read. This time I was smart and checked it out from the library.",

These other films have a balance that allows more adults to enjoy them as well as the intended target of younger teenagers. \"JTMD\" appeals more to that teen crowd and has older viewers wondering if this has anything new to offer.. and wonder is all I did. This film tries taking a lot of plot lines and ideas from other teen films and brings them all together.. the results are one BIG mess. 2.5 stars is all I can give.. the other films mentioned above are the ticket. \"Heathers\" = 5 stars. \"Mean Girls\" = 4 stars. \"Bring it on\" = 4 stars. \"Clueless\" 4.5 stars.

Some that were notable were the use and creation of semaphore objects, threading, CPU scheduling, and disk scheduling algorithms. The semaphores and threading were particularly useful in completing the classic synchronization problem 'The Dining Philosophers' which was one of the assignments for the course. The breakdown of disk organization was another very beneficial and highly interesting topic. The book covers MAC OS, Linux, Unix, Windows, as well as some information about older systems such as DOS and CP/M. The book has generalized examples and each topic includes a good deal of theory.

I'm not sure what the heck MS was thinking when they developed this version. Office 2000, XP and 2003 were logical upgrades, but this? I am not sure.Because commands are so difficult to find, the software seems to have \"much less\" functionality than previous versions. I don't have time to read a book on how to use the software so I am struggling while using the software.I wish there were a \"2003 or XP\" UI for users that want to use it that way. (There could be, but I cannot find it).For now 2003 is definitely a better choice, meaning I don't think that I would ever \"upgrade\" to the latest office.",

Much better music exists from this region (i.e.: Gardenian, Soilwork, In Flames, At the Gates, Edge of Sanity, Entombed.....), which is why this represents a negative impact for such a talented sector of the death-metal compass. If you're experimenting with Northern European death music, this CD is an unwise purchase.",

All I did was adjust it up and down now and then, as both me and my then-6 year old play. It just snapped. Pretty much impossible to repair, also, due to the way it's constructed. So for the last couple of years, I've just had a really short piano bench. Nobody uses it. I'll probably screw a piece of wood or two on it in between the framed pad and the main part of the bench, to elevate the pad enough to make it usable. But then it will look crappy. My suggestion would be to avoid this product. Either get one of those X-frame benches ($50 or less), or spring for a decent piano bench (usually well above $200).

Doug makes us rethink about God, about prayer, and about how we lead our lives and the consequences we face in the next life. I have never read a book written from this point of view and on this topic. It is refreshing to be surprised in life. I say, \"Well done, Doug. Write another one while the ink is hot!\"",

Well, I don't have to tell you that with the fall of facism, Pasquale had to leave Italy, and fast! He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate.

McKidd takes us through his character Franks life with zeal rarely seen (sorry Brad Pitt could never touch McKidd). McKidd can be hideously ugly and violent in one scence, stunningly beautiful the next. Throughout the film we are repulsed by Frankie, learn to love him, and (spoiler warning) hope the beating he recieves at the hands of his old \"friends\" acts as a final catharsis for his old life (instead of him getting killed). As he was in Bedrooms and Hallways, Rome, Dog Soldiers, and Journeyman, McKidd is infinitely fascinating to watch, and certainly the best actor out there today.",

Mechwarrior 3's voice acting was superb, everytime my commander in the MFB said something, i really made sure to listen. But geez, these guys just don't care. Plus the video quality is terrible compared to MW3, really choppy and botched colors. This is what microsoft does; they take a good name and try to make it all flashy and cute when it doesn't need it. Mechwarrior 3 was a true Mech simulation, this is just a flashy ... arcade game.",

The best tracks are: 3(Come in 007 your time is up), 6(Welcome to Baku), 8(Ice Bandits), and 12 (Pipeline). Number 3(Come in 007 your time is up) has a lot of the James Bond theme in it and is a fast paced track. Number 6(Welcome to Baku) is a good steady kind of India-like version of the James Bond theme. It is too short though. 8 (Ice Bandits) is a good fast-paced track with a great instrumental of the World Is Not Enough. You know what I mean by instrumental. Not the entire song, just a few instrumental parts in Ice Bandits. And finally, 12(pipeline) is a very fast paced, tense, suspenseful, and exciting track. You really have to listen to it well for it to be a suspenseful track. All in all it is a good soundtrack. Minus one star for some boring tracks though.",

Makes you cringe when you watch it; as I said, it takes a big ego to make a movie this rotten during those times. If I were JL, I would have bought every copy and burned them.",

I can almost always tell from the start if books are going to be good. This one started out real lame. Holly Smith/Randall or whatever her name is, discovers she is adopted and then she gets a phone call from her real great aunt. Then the aunt is later killed and Holly comes running to the family's house. She does not get along with a lot of the family members. She feels that the housekeepers son is strange and so on. I feel like I need some ALEGRE! BUT... I loved Tom Savage's novel \"VALENTINE,\" that was a great novel believe it or not. \"The Inheritance\" is NOT!",

I enjoy the film for what it is, a wonderfully emotional and engrossing tale, with very believable performances and top notch production values.

For one thing, the N64 graphic by today's standards are horrible and since when is a James Bond movie ripoff realistic? This game's plot isnt realistic by any means, but the story is much more intelligent. The graphics are superb, which makes me wonder how Halo 2 is going to push our X-boxes to the limit. The vehicle system is amazing, real time shocks put into the Warthog make driving it on all terrains out of this world. And the sound is beyond compare.Perhaps it is simply because they wouldnt allow you to run around as a super-spy who's escapades get half of every country blown up, but really folks.

One hard thing about the game is paying bells(bells is what they call money) to Tom Nook. When you first get the house you have to pay him 17,400 bells, and when you expand your house you have to pay 145,700 bells! The characters all say a phrase at the end of each sentance.

The plot ended up being a little thin and the ending was a let down.My biggest objection was the multiple uses of the word \"sucks\" and at least one \"freaking\" (as a substitute for the \"F\" word). Maybe it's acceptable for teens to use these words on a regular basis but I didn't feel it was appropriate for a 9 year old. I discontinued this book with my kids after 2 chapters for this reason. Call me old fashioned but I just thought other parents might like to know the content.As other reviewers have mentioned, the treatment of the war was a little much for this age as well.",

The dialogs were contrived, clichéd and stale. The predictability was huge, and the happy ending was tear-inducing. Sean Connery plays Sean Connery, Dennis Quaid plays Dennis Quaid, Jay Mohr can't act, and Angelina Jolie's break-up phone conversation was unbearable. The best thing in the movie is the drag queen.

The second side contained the a and b sides of all the singles the Beatles released in 1967 (other than \"I am the Walrus\", which was on the first side of the album). There are a lot of great songs here, of course, but the album doesn't hold up that well as a cohesive unit. It feels more like a collection of songs than an actual album. Of course, you can't complain too much when you get great songs like \"I am the Walrus\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Penny Lane\" and \"All You Need is Love\". The one track I will criticize is \"Flying\". I hope my fellow Beatlemaniacs will forgive me, but I have to say that this is one of the boringest instrumentals ever recorded.

The main fault lies in Long's often times hard-edged, rhythmically unimaginative approach, which deadens the character and saps the poetry out of most selections. We know that a hard and inflexible approach is what Scriabin himself most abhorred in performances of his works. I get the impression that Long is not in touch with Scriabin's highly individual, mystical sound-universe. The approach is altogether too straightforward and prosaic, although not lacking in liveliness and drive. In addition, there are actual rhythmical and notational misreadings: for example, in op. 3 no.7 ms.66 or op.3 no.9 ms.30. Why save a little more with this Naxos release when Long largely misses the point and other versions (Le Van, Feinberg, Pizarro) manage to bring out the essence, the emotional depth and mystery of these works ?",

You will not find long windeded explanations of the math behind the theory. Egan keeps the discussion at a very abstract level and talks about the details mostly in realtion to their social and moral impact.

And since this page gives such great details that are found within the book, I will not bore you with details of my own. Let’s just say that if I was able to raise the capital and there was interest for a book store in my area, this book would have helped my business soar!",

He also said that the cheaper the book the less likely it would be able to search or to localize a word. Also not true- I bought a kindle book for $7- twenty times cheaper than this useless book and am able to search what I want with no problems.More than likely this book has not been properly processed for kindle.

Stanton explores complex questions of heritage, tourism and public history detailing how the past shapes the present and the present shapes the interpretation of the past. In addition, she unveils the many challenges and limitations public historians have being both interpreters and contributors to history at historic sites. Stanton's writing is smooth and graceful filled with thought and detail. I would highly recommend this book for both graduate courses as well as readers interested in the politics of historic sites. There is no wonder this book took home the National Council of Public History's book prize, for it is truly a winner.",

The movie is very slow moving, and Jude Law, while usually a fantastic actor in even the drabbest setting, was unmistakably boring. Law plays a \"vampire\" who feeds off the emotions his victims carry in their blood. He keeps records of the victims with the particular emotion they had that was fulfilling for him. He wooed his victims for a time and each fell in love with him before meeting their death. Until the final victim, whose name escapes me because she was bad, makes him fall in love with her and she in turns becomes the death of him. this movie is not bad but it is far from great.. definitely wait for cable...",

I presume because most of us mortals are only blessed with a certain dose of brilliance and once that's used, tough luck. One theory--the author wrote ''Ashes'' long ago, or at least kept a journal so his remembrances were fresh. When the first book took off, he was forced to write the next installment and he was working from faded memory and writing through too many years' worth of cynicism. The lack of humor in the sequel was glaring, and that was the biggest letdown to me. ''Ashes'' was a revelation and ''Tis'' was a slap in the face. Sorry to be so hard on the author, but my expectations were dashed.",

His youth and inexperience are probably reflected most in the slower ballad numbers like A HANDFUL OF STARS where he sticks pretty close to the melody. He can tear apart up-tempo numbers, though, and IF DREAMS COME TRUE is a real roof-raiser. Bucky and John Pizzarelli offer solid support, and what a treat (and learning experience) it must have been to have Houston Person guest on tenor sax on a few numbers. Will Weinstein be the heir apparent to Stephane Grappelli? With continued dedication to his instrument and the art form - and a little bit of luck - Weinstein should become a well-known performer on swing-oriented CDs and concert/club appearances. All the best to him.",

Kapur does a wonderful job dissecting the the everyday of an ordinary life, showing how even the ordinary in this generation can be claustrophobic. Kapur highlights how women were taught that caring for anything outside the small world created for you (whether it is in an ashram, your parent's house, or your husband's house) was not normal. The character of Asta struggles with this throughout the book, using her art and then eventual political activism to be a part of the world. Her affair is another outlet for this connection.

I highly recommend it if you need to relax, get away from it all for a bit, and need some serenity in your life. Being a single mother hasn't been easy either, so it helps me when my kids overwhelm me. It's worth the price to find peace again.",

Interesting and has fun facts, but from what understand the Coca-Cola mythology has been skewed in recent times. Yet, this little factoid does not take away from the rest of the book which looks at, with pictures, Coca-Colas merchandising effort from collectible bottles, slogans, advertisements and anything else that can be sold to the public. A good book for a beginner in advertising and an interest in Coca-Cola, as well as the collector.",

I was delighted to see Terra products come up in my search, since I have enjoyed Terra Sweet Potato chips for some time (sweet potatoes are on the clean 15 list for low pesticide residue). However, since a product's organic status is generally a selling point that is highly advertised on its packaging, I did feel the need to do some independent research to confirm that these are organic. They are not. No one is making this claim for any of Terra's products but Amazon. Terra is not making it on its own website. So, if you are concerned about your family's pesticide consumption, none of Terra's non-sweet potato chip offerings can help.",

And I just don't believe that anyone could transport all those people into the holodeck with no-one noticing.I've taken one star off because of the repellent atttitudes the crew of the Enterprise display in this episode. They will not lift a finger to intervene and save the Boraalans, which they could easily do without the Boraalans ever noticing. There seems to be no place for compassion or mercy in their world, as they flatter themselves that they are acting with nobler aims than is Nikolai. Picard's posturing was particularly annoying.

My only gripe is hair and some carpet fuzz wrapped around the beater bar and I had to pull it off, but that probably would have happened with anything else considering how much of it there was in the carpet. expensive but worth it.",

It lacks the science needed to help couples succeed and doesn't provide any new information to make it worthwhile.The best book out there and at a third less cost is \"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\" (ISBN 1569243719). It's written by a reproductive endocrinologist (a fertility patient himself) and a freelance journalist (his patient) and provides a step-by-step balanced and well researched account of what treatment is like and what readers can do to iron out the kinks they come across. It's easy to read, insightful, and humorous when appropriate. It follows a number of patients through their ordeals, addresses the latest cutting edge technologies and those in the pipeline, and is much more supportive than this book.Bottom-line, if you need a book on infertility, \"A Few Good Eggs\" ain't it.",

Strange. But so far, our son hasn't noticed.",

There is another review on here where the person says you have to listen to the songs at least 3 times because they aren't catchy. I'm sorry, but I thought that was a sign of poor songwriting. No matter what style of music you play, if the song is good it's gonna get stuck in your head. This album doesn't. I've listened to it more than 3 times and I honestly can't hum a single tune from it outside of Miss Murder which is being played everywhere right now. And that song's not very good. It has no structure. It's just a 3 minute length of sound with some Davey Havok screeching. Some of the songs are like a mix between AFI and Depeche Mode. I don't know. I think this band hit it's prime with Sing The Sorrow and can probably look forward to coasting swiftly downhill pretty quickly.",

I had considered buying Space Bags because I thought they would NOT leak. However, it sounds as though some of these bags leak faster than my own garbage bags. In that case, I will just keep using my own method.",

The first one was the more expensive 'chrome' unit, which is identical to the white one but comes with one 3 stage filter instead of one 2 stage filter. Both filters fit in both units, so its really disingenuous that they advertise the chrome unit as somehow different or better.The first (chrome) unit I had lasted about ten months, at which point it developed a leak in the see through indicator and would spray you with water when you used it.We moved, so I left the old unit behind and bought a new unit (the white one) in July. Now, only four months later, it has developed three seperate cracks, this time in the white casing. I find it unbelievable that Pur did not use stronger plastic. Now we are left with a box of filters we bought expecting to use, and a broken water filter. I have mixed feelings whether to buy another Pur unit or just throw the filters away and start with a new brand. Horrible product.",

In the end she achieves neither one nor the other. The vocabulary she includes is totally insufficient for a rookie, whilst the constant return to english is an annoying digression for advanced learners. The examples given are very limited in scope and don't always achieve exemplary quality.Perhaps Ochoa should have written two separate books to serve the different sections of the audience she aims to reach. As it is, with her actual book she serves neither.",

Cedrics voice actualy get's a little rediculous at a couple places : Tetragrammaton 9:14- 10:41, again at the beggining of Meccamputechture, and one last time at 10:19 of Day of the Baphomets. He sounds like one of the darn Chipmonks at these parts. Other than that his voice isn't near as awesome and all over the place like it was on Frances.This IS a great album, don't get me wrong.

Taking place where the government controls everything, and punishes profit and success as greed, by distribution of successful peoples wealth. Even though the story was published over 50 years ago the themes and plot still ring true in America today, and even mirror our current economic struggles! This one just took the spot of personal favorite of mine!",

There is a scene right before the wedding where Meryl Streep is singing for several minutes about how she doesn't want to talk, while Pierce Brosnan is standing there in what for him must have been an excruciating reaction shot. But I also felt he was thinking: \"This is dreadful. Thank heavens we're filming at a great location and tonight we can get drunk at the taverna in town.\" The acting seems forced and phony, and I could not identify with anyone in the movie. The idea that a young woman would somehow think it romantic (which is what the bride-to-be expresses in her opening song) that her mother had sex with three different men in succession strains credulity.

Songs was open before this, but not on Broadway. As his debut, this is an amazing piece of work. The music is stunning and powerful, complex but extremely pleasing. The emotion that all of Browns music is able to convey is never missing from this score. The singers are generally good, the story is enjoyable and you don't need a synopsis to get the gist of it. Prince actually approached Brown with the idea for an American Opera, so most of the story takes place on this CD. Brown's Ensemble numbers are as good as the solo heart rippers, and the ever stunning duets (that you will find in ALL his scores.) This is a CD for Brown fans, Broadway collectors, and even older listeners. I strongly suggest you get this CD. Fav Song: \"It's Hard to Speak My Heart.\"",

Even better, if I start it when I take the pizza out of the freezer, it is completely preheated by the time I can put some extra cheese and pepperoni on it.The buttons and digital readouts are easy to use and offer good precision for temperature setting. I haven't been able to find a way to make the timer turn off the oven and that is a minus. It does allow you to chain together button commands for complex cooking programs. This seems overly complicated to me, but I'm just a heat and eat kind of guy. Other folks may find them useful.Overall it exceeded my expectations, and at the price they were already pretty high.

From the high-energy hard rockers to the lovely, acoustic ballads, this song is a FANTASTIC way to get to know the band KISS. Think, 21 tracks, and it covers the '74-'92 era (well, not really an era), but all the same, it will be a valuable addition to your collection, especially if you like classic rock and pop-metal like me.If you liked this album and want to build a KISS collection, I would also suggest: ''Destroyer'', ''Rock and Roll Over'', ''Love Gun'', the original ''KISS'' and ''Creature of the Night''.

I don't know what happens later, but for at least 10-12 hours you spend walking a crooked line in a canyon fighting bad guys every ten steps. Other than the start of a basic story with some nice cut scenes thats it. If it takes this long to teach you a new fighting system, then what does that tell you. Since I forked out the bucks I will continue, but if I were you I would rent or borrow from a friend. God,I hope it gets better.",

Well, this book answers those questions and many more.Mr. Aleem's premier novel deals with disenfranchised masses that are the oil and gears running the American machine. As told from the perspective of Demetrius Williams, an ex-cop, the country is in a state of war with itself. Frustration over the distribution of wealth, educational resources, and the isolation imposed by todays societal demands are the breeding ground for an underground movement, a call to revolution for the American working class! Not the \"blue collars\" of generations past, but the lower \"98%\" of the Regan-Bush generation...If you liked Fight Club, than you'll love Guerillas!",

Hamlet was a great play, filled with exciment of Hamlet's next move,mystery of the ghost,treason and finally death. Hamlet's procrastination is his tragic flaw; Laertes is a nice contrasting character to Hamlet and is a great example of Hamlet's tragic flaw directly effecting others in the play.Hamlet is filled with sorrow and grief, it is easy for the reader to sympathize with the characters of the play. I would recommend this play to every Shakespeare fan!",

It begins with Sara (Jennifer Aniston) heading with her boyfriend/fiancee to her younger sister's weddding. Once there she gets involved in a 'rumor' about her family and finds out her deceased mom and very much alive grandmother slept with the same guy and they made a movie about it: The Graduate! Now she becomes obsessed with finding this guy. She goes and finds him and a romance ensues (onces she's sure he's not her dad, I'll admit that part was kind of weird.) It goes on from there. I won't ruin the ending, but it was a bit anti-climatic. I can see why Jennifer Aniston is trying to disown this one, but it's a decent rental. It is better than some of the other romantic comedies Hollywood has been trying to shove down our throats lately, that's for sure. Give it a try!!",

This text is actually a paperback reissue of the English translation of the 1989 French orginal. Nonetheless, Le Bohec's text updates and surpasses earlier treatments and is the most reliable overview of the subject at the present time. I found the chapter on the practical and symbolic value of \"training\" fascinating, and the chapter on the strategic deployment of the legions is valuable for an understanding of the attempts Rome made to deal with external threats. Less successful is the book's brief \"history\" of the army--essentially a chronological look at the emperors and how they rated as generals. The treatment is far too compressed. However, Le Bohec's final chapters on the socio-economic impact of the Roman army on Europe are first-rate. A fine treatment and one of interest to anyone who studies Roman history.",

The song selection for the film was very good, most having become concert staples all these years later. The Stones' performances on each and every song is great and their fans will be glad to have these peformances for posterity.The movie itself is not perfect.

It's relevant to Scriptural studies, but not the book for a beginner. However, despite my disappointment, I read the book all the way through. Despite the fact that I have little background in archaeology, I was impressed by how clear the writing was. Mazar does a fantastic job conveying the development of the area, and discussing how the people lived in each era. If you're more interested in the Bible, this isn't your book.

Pass on the Red Guide, and follow your instincts (or the advice of the concierge) to find good food...and do internet research on hotels before you leave (the info from the red guide in online anyway at www.viamichelin.com).",

So far it seems to be OK--I have cooked some of my favorites in it and they have not burned, although the cooker did test a little hot when I tested it. It is very attractive to look at. I also like the countdown timer better than the old smartpots. Thank you Rival for making it right; I got a better, more expensive model that seems to be working well.

    "text": "Alex Bugnon's albun \"Soul Purpose\" has the makings of a contemporary jazz classic; not because any one of the songs is extarordinary, but because all the songs are worth listening. Bugnon's keyboard and writing skills have increased consistently with each release and \"Soul Purpuse\" is no exception. It's soulful and jazzy, and even has a gospel edge (\"Changes\").The title track has a definate Memphis soul influence, with noticeably fuller instrumentation than the other tracks. The remake of Bugnon's own \"Around 12:15 AM\" (from his first album \"Love Season\"), which starts the album, is elegant and fresher than the original. The only disappointment is \"EWF,\" a trbute to R&B group Earth Wind & Fire that exudes little of their influence. But even that song is worthy of a listen.",

This movie seemingly is the kind of stuff highschoolers (like me) make with lots of violence, no story, and poor editing.His advice is to not use a tripod, but to move the camera a lot. This, he says, adds tension to the movie. Personally, I regret not buying Robert Rodruiguez's book 'Rebel Without a Crew,' because not only is the movie El Mariachi the greatest low budget movie of all time, but the filmmaking involved with making a movie for cheap is very useful.This book is not total trash, there is a few pages towards the end which are useful, like stereotyping people and how to use them in movies, and doing special effects. Unfortunatly, for the most part, it's just stipid filler with no content about a nothing movie that no one besides the filmmaker himself has seen.",

Myles, if you're going to write a book on the Kingdom of God, use the Bible as research material. It clearly teaches that NOT all religions are \"a result of man's attempt to respond to his desire to find some type of meaningful, and possibly intimate, relationship with a Supreme Being\" (pg. 18), instead, the Bible teaches that Judeo Christian religions were initiated by Jehovah God.

I have had no problems with rust, but I do not put them in the dishwasher. I have had them sharpened and maintained the blade with the honing steel (no, that's not a knife sharpener!) and they have stayed in good condition - even the chef's knife, which I use just about every day. The kitchen shears are probably my least favorite part of the set, but easily replaceable with another pair. They are nicely weighted and the grip is comfortable. The chef's knife has good clearance for your knuckles as well. That's about all I ask for in an inexpensive knife set. I didn't expect them to last this long, but they have been reliable until now!",

It's particularly enjoyable to see the twisted relationship of Gabriel, a good shepard graced with a dumb dog, and Bathsheba, the object of his attention and affection. Yes, plot contrivances abound, but the rest of Hardy's plot makes up for it nontheless. Enjoy!",

I had a hard time finishing this book. It was boring. Byron the most boring carpathanian of all. Antonietta was a nynpho. Byron gets shot and is out for three days in a healing sleep. Which was corny in previous books the healing was for more damage done and by a vampire of massive power. Which this book was lacking. The only thing good was more background information on the species. It is good to be different but this book was so different from the others, that I did not like it. I could just say if it was your first book you could enjoy it, but if you are reading the series from the beginning, this book was a huge dissapointment.",

    "text": "I had read that most people spend 40 or more hours per week earning their money and 5 hours per year managing their nest egg. That was me. I decided to do something about it, and began by educating myself more on stock investing. Over the course of 2 high tech careers, my wife and I accumulated dozens of mutual funds and stocks. Each year, we'd look at the results and say either \"that was a good year\" or on occasion the other. This book gave me a great start on doing that type of analysis. The only downside I'll mention (which cost this book a star) is that the book talks about how great the \"dogs of the dow strategy\" is - that you easily beat the S&P by spending a few minutes a year finding the top dividend dow issues. Several years after the book was published, Motley Fool decided that it was not valid. I got all excited only to find out that they'd abandoned that strategy.",

Like gladiators in Rome, these courageous men allow us to project our hopes, fears, and insecurities.David Remnick tells the story of Cassius Clay's growth from a skinny, mercurial, but morally upright boy, to a hero and symbol of resistance and hope for millions of anti-establishment figures. Ali captivated the hearts and minds of fans unlike any athlete before or since. Remnick does a beautiful job of explaining why and how this happened. No matter how dominate Michael Jordan was, or Tiger Woods is, neither absorb our emotions like the sponge known as Muhammed Ali.His grace, speed, and power thrilled, while his words, political stances, and humour enthralled. Everyone in America should learn the story of this hero. There is no better place than Remnick's book to do so. Highly recommended.",

The book starts out with a big explosion, which brings us to the main characters Kate, Dirk, Thor, and Odin. Kate was brought into the story by the explosion because almost seconds before she was trying to help Thor buy a ticket to Oslo. Thor is the son of Odin who acts like a child. Dirk is a private detective working on a case that deals with the gods. The book was hilariously funny, the deranged eagle, the street light thing, and Thor being glued to the floor were some of the more amusing things.

I can see students carrying their Kindle instead of carting a load of books around in a backpack all day. It is so fast and easy to use. It easily fits in a purse so you have it with you at all times. I can even read several books at the same time which I didn't like doing before because I didn't like carrying them all with me. You never run out of reading material since the Whispernet is always with you. I bought 2 and gave one to my sister.

Balance and dynamic range (very wide) are both good as well.All that said, I again agree with other reviewers that it seems Vanska never quite lets go of the reins. The attention to detail almost lends the performance an air of coldness and a somewhat reduced range of emotion. My personal preference for the Beethoven cycle remains Karajan.

And Hillary, far from being self-aggrandizing, seems to shun the spotlight.Certainly, Hillary makes fairly little of his pre-Everest climbs, although they undoubtedly made him a splendid mountaineer. His lyrical voice for settings and experiences is fine, though never as poetical as Peter Matthiessen in THE SNOW LEOPARD, who traversed much of the same ground.One of the shortcomings of this book is the lack of an Afterword in the new edition.

See, I decided to play the normal sims section for a bit before going into the new sections. What I found was that the expansion had rendered almost all the characters unplayable. Any families where the maid who was previously present, discovered she couldn't leave. Random tasks trapped sims in loops. Characters went downtown and never exited the taxi ever again...Here I am, a year after the initial release, trying again now that a patch has been issued 10 months later. And ten minutes into the game two characters are trapped, having snuck out and been swallowed whole by a new or unresolved bug.So I still haven't played the University portion. After the patch, this is still a major disappointment.",

Very nice for short practice days. The DVD is very well chaptered and has more instruction as a separate chaptere after the workout. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in a shorter routine. They did a great job putting together a good sequence of postures that flows, and also discuss someof the more cerebral aspects of yoga (which can be avoided if that is your choice).",

Jo Van Fleet is also terrific as her grasping mother, too eager to give her daughter the life she never had, and her scenes with Hayward are among the best in the film.

I don't have a problem with slow jams, I love Jaheim, and a few other brothers that can really sing their hearts out, but when I think of usher, I think dance moves, i think funky beats, this album just doesn't have enough of that for me.",

Regardless, the unit didn't work with either version of Musicmatch.Perhaps a working version of this unit would be a wonderful thing, ... There appear far too many problem units out there since many seem to be many others having the same or similar problems with it.",

There were a few well done, loose, expressive drawings, but most of the drawings that purported to be realistic were badly drawn. I'm not talking about niceties such as line quality, or rendering of surface details either. There were gross perspective and proportional errors in far too many of the author's drawings! Buy Hamm's \"How to Draw Animals\" instead. It may have a dated look, but the information is still first rate, and the drawings are accurate.",

The overall feeling is very soothing, from the grooves of \"Survival\" to the beat of \"Secret\". Nearly every song on this album is cohesive and well-written. \"Inside of Me\" (about Madonna's mother!) is a very pretty, sad song. \"Human Nature\" is even well integrated. I've always thought \"Bedtime Story\" was weird, but it fits when paired with \"Sanctuary\". The album closes with \"Take A Bow\", a beautiful song that is timeless, and understandably Madonna's biggest hit. If you are a Madonna fan and don't own this album, buy it now!

The story and plot follow the story told in the Song Of Solomon much more than they do Romeo & Juliet. As a Jewish man, who happens to be a hip-hop artist, that is married to a Jamaican Rastafarian Brooklynite woman, maybe I found this story just way too irresistable.No Brooklyn Babylon isn't a cinematic classic, but it beats almost everything else geared towards the young urban demographic with it's intelligence & relatability.",

The chapter, Holy Homosexuals, while interesting hardly belonged with the rest of the book. The other chapter dealing with sexuality only surveyed Focus on the Family publications. It ignored denominational publications - there must be some. I am still not convinced Focus on the Family is representative. These chapters felt like Evengelical books reviewing the beliefs of other religions: here are their beliefs and why they are wrong.

This film does not sacrifice story for action, as is the case with most other films. Therefore, it is my opinion that U-571 is among my favorite films.

Also, the backdrop is made out of cardboard. CARDBOARD! It doesn't attach firmly and keeps falling off. I don't think Mattel bothers to test market their toys with actual children anymore.

Both editions are included, the 1890 version that was published as a serial, and the 1891 version that was printed in novel form. The 1890 version is much more potent, and clearly more controversial than that of 1891, which has many chapters added to soften the overall effect of the book. Profuse footnotes illuminate Wilde's sources, which range from the pedestrian to the fantastic. Finally, the book concludes with some contemporary responses to the story, Wilde's rebuttals of them, and modern criticism. After the book's end, the criticism pulls readers into making long leaps of inference and symbolic interpretation.

There are a few drawbacks though. the stroller accomidates our graco snugride infant seat with the special attachment but does not seam very secure. also it is rather long making it a bit more difficult to get around.other other than that it was relatively easy to put together and there is tons of storage space.",

I have read my fair share of books about genetics, and try to keep up-to-date with the scientific literature with regards to population genetics in particular. This is probably why reading this book came as such a disappointment to me. It already seems so antiquated. The fact that the writing style is so dense and repetitive does not help either. The strong point are the maps and statistic tables, but even they are of little value if you have seen more recent data, notably Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA studies. My recommendation would be to purchase a newer book on the subject.

I was sooo excited and I told my husband and friends I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENT OF FINANCES FOR THE SAME THING! It's shining a very clear picture of Spider-Man on top.

It also tells about their maritime adventures every summer in Nantucket. Though this family goes through many scrapes and quarrels, they are resilient and always persevere.I love this book and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor wishing for a funny book.

Her first couple of Anita Blake books involved a whole new kind of story line which I liked. Her next several books involved a whole new kind of story line with a very sensual element which I really liked. Now we've come full circle. Most of the book covers sex scenes, usually kinky. A lot of what's left over involves discussion with people in her life and with herself; lots of angst here. Obviously, this leaves very little room for anything resembling an actual plot.Laurell isn't the only game in town with this kind of supernatural story line any more. I hate to say it, but some of the other authors are doing it better. Even when she's poor, Laurell Hamilton is still worth reading, but I'll probably wait for the paperback on her next effort.",

Certainly she was an ordinary everywoman, as intended, but this is exactly the type of character you almost never see in science fiction. She's not a technical uber-guru or a speed-freak street-warrior, but those stock types are hardly a benchmark for realism in characterization. As for the settings, I've lived most of my life in Texas, and could sense how comfortable Sterling was with Texan characters in the first few pages. While I've never been to the other settings, I found the story evocative, and especially felt like he was working from a substantial map of Singapore in his head from having spent a fair amount of time there.",

Based on a 1987 science fiction bestseller (in Japan; it was never published in the US), Yukikaze tells the story of a war fought between mankind and a mysterious alien race known only as JAM. The battles take place on a faraway planet called Fairy (accessible via a strange cloud near the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica). While the war has been going on for over thirty years, the majority of the population on Earth believes the JAM threat is just an urban legend.The intense action scenes are balanced with a focus on the characters. However, you will have to pay attention when watching Yukikaze--it is not for casual viewers. Fans of science fiction, high adventure, or aircraft buffs should give this series a look. Another fantastic work from GONZO.",

Eventhough , I kept it connected to power for 24hrs without doing any activity , my laptop was always showong that it got charged 0%.When I contacted toshiba customer care support , it was pathetic .Everybody was transferring my call to the other person . I had to talk to 7 different people before I could get the actual person .Anyway I had submitted my claim and I am hopeful that they will approve it .",

Now this book has no exciting twists and is not very interesting. It is worth reading but only if you have to. I have read much better books than this one.

In order to do well (especially on the more difficult tracks), you have to know when you need to decelerate or brake. Same goes for the speed burst - do it too soon, and you'll power-wheelie yourself flat on your back. Once you get the hang of it, though, the game is addictive. There are a few sections when a well-timed Nitro burts sends you flying, and it's a rush to see the ground slipping away below you. Makes me want to see the McGrath supercross game even more. If you're having a hard time with this one, be patient. Slow down heading into big turns and accelerate as you round the bend - you'll be amazed how tightly you can corner.

Gossip, juicy stories etc. For me, one of the most fascinating things about Lennon was that he was a Liverpool thug who had to wear a Beatle suit. Cynthia Lennon really comes across as being a bit dim. For my money, the most interesting part of a famous person's life, is what they were like before they were famous - she could have done a better job on this early period. For a decent book, read Albert Goldman's book or Pete Shotton's \"In My Life\".",

I can hold one end of the bokken in one hand, the other end in the other hand, and turn the straight bokken into a 'C' with a fair amount of pressure. Meaning when you are sparring, the tip tends to bend away from your opponent's sword, possibly giving the opponent enough room to slip his sword by.

Where is the plot and charm and suspense of the previous Alien films?There are pretty costumes and matte backgrounds from Space Family Robinson. The boss alien resembles the Michelin Man. He collects black oil from the X-Files, gets raped by an octopus, and their kid looks like H.R. Giger's classic conehead.

That said, our son did always have fun pushing it all around the yard, and sitting on it and pushing with his feet. And it's durable, after 2 years he still has not been able to destroy it. Oh and the pushing handle it definitely too low if you're tall like me!",

Watching the plot unfold was almost painful, as it seemed to make stops at as many stereotypes as they could cram in there. Maybe they didn't want to take the time to write real characters so they relied on exagerrations. You have the \"Hey baby\" guy at the club (who tries to get the girl into bed by leaving her alone on the dance floor at her showing the slightest hint of interest) you have the dirty old man at the golf course, you have the sleazy biker, the Something-About-Mary-ish gross out jokes (most of which are unfortunately not even remotely funny) I could go on and on. I'm not sure if the characters were supposed to be ditzy and shallow or if that was just a result of bad writing, either way I couldn't care less what happened to them, I just couldn't wait for the movie to finally end.",

After a while, the steam function started acting up: sometimes there were loads of it coming out of the iron, sometimes I would have to press it on the garmet then hold it in a horizontal position for 10 seconds for the steam to give any sign of life. Finally, about a year ago it started to leak. I would have put up with it, except it leaked a black-brownish liquid which would not subsequetly wash off the clothes. It does not leak continuously, but it would leak at least 3-4 times during a 30 minutes ironing session. The black plate finish is very cheap - it came off after about 2 years of weekly use.I finally gave up on it last week and forked out some money for a Rowenta - the difference in quality is huge.",

I could break each song down but they prefer you use less than a thousand words. The performances on this double cd are flawless. You get excerpts from two nights at Long Beach areana and a few songs from Donnington. This is pure greatness in my opinion. It could well be the best live album of all time in my book. Listen to the samples if you have any doubt. I have bought this album many times on all three major forms of media(I just worn them out). This reissue is better than the innitial release because you get all the songs that were on the record set instead of one condensed cd that was originally released in the 80's. Up the Irons!",

The Who never attempted anything so ambitious again, but 10,000 Days is Tool's third consecutive masterwork.Stravinsky wrote the Rite of Spring in the early 1900's and brought rhythm to the fore in serious music. The Rite of Spring famously caused a riot at its premiere in Paris, but it successfully dragged the public down a new road paving the way for Prokofieff, Bartok and a wave of modern composers who used rhythm in ways unimagined in the 19th Century.Tool is the Stravinsky of modern music, and 10,000 days is driven by an onslaught of rhythmical expression as intense as in their prior albums.

It was like the first Graham Greene or John LeCarre that I read, well-written, engrossing, a true protoypical page turner...I am curious now to see whether this is Banville's style, the exquisite use of language and biting and ironic humor or is it the \"style\" of Victor Maskell, the protagonist and narrator of this wonderfully written book..I highly recommend it to all espionage fans, anglophiles and anyone who is as fascinated as I am with the Cambridge/Cold War/Double agent phase of recent British history",

As others have mentioned the \"glow in the dark\" feature is in the form of stickers, which don't stick really well the day you install them, I don't expect the to last long. Also the range on this gun is not very good. It usually fires a dart about 15 feet, occasionally the dart will go 25 feet. My son has about a dozen Nerf guns, and most of them shoot 25+ feet consistently. If it was my choice I would (and did) buy the Maverick for $8. It also has a barrel (with 6 darts), so you don't have to reload after every shot. The Maverick is a bit smaller, and it doesn't have the lights that this one does. The Maverick shoots much farther than this gun, more consistently. Also the Maverick doesn't require batteries.If you want a gun that looks cool this one is good. If you want to have fun playing with the gun there are many better choices.",

Also, I agree with the other reviewer to not get the whitening goo on your hands, it will make them white too. Also, you have to be very careful not to swallow these, I almost did once. And these white strips are for people only, pets will not tolerate them, and I don't think there are white strips available for pets.",

The story (if there is one) jumps around with no point, it seems.

Not as good as my electric cooker, but not bad at all. I cooked a smaller amount than the directions gave and found I needed more water and cooking time--perhaps a variance in the type of microwave used. It did leak a little around the edges but nothing a paper towel could not handle. For less than $10, you can't go wrong with this--it is worth a little experimentation.Addendum: I found out if I used the 70% wattage on the micrwave that I can follow the directions included with the cooker exactly and get the right results. It does say in the directions to cook on medium strength. No overflow or anything on 70%. I am even more pleased!",

Naturally, bad things start to happen when the doors are locked from the outside and the guests cannot escape.It is not bloody or gory; rather, it relies on suspense and tension- much is left up to the viewer's imagination.

Overall Larson wanted the best of both worlds, history told as relaxed fiction and he ended up with a mess. I think many readers here did not actually read the same book as I did.",

It would be much more accurate to file this CD under 'long-winded political and religious rants'. It may be spot-on as political commentary but certainly not as comedy. Although perhaps some people enjoy listening to someone read from a Promisekeepers program. I can't get rid of this boring CD quickly enough.And before you attack me, I enjoy left wing and off-color comedy immensely. In fact most of the best comedians are both left-wing and off-color. Lewis Black and George Carlin are two who jump to mind as being able to skillfully merge politics and comedy into something amusing regardless of your own political views. The priority on a comedy CD should be, make sure you are funny first and THEN work in political commentary.",

Fine, but I started to get annoyed with Nick, and soon I wanted him tied up, flogged, and feathered. I found him to be a very weak foil used to point out human weakness; any well conceived character would've had a clue by the first 200 pages to hoist up the white flag and call it a day.

Initially though there is some 'burn-in' to get the best sound, for me a sound that has rich bass. It is also imperative to get a good fit in the ear - they have to go all the way in! I pinch & lift the top of my ear when I insert them so that the seal is snug & the bass is further optimised, because without that snugness I found that the bass can be reduced. Also try the different size earbuds that come in the pack as this will aid the fit.Build quality is good, the cable feels solid & once slotted in I can comfortably wear them all day & enjoy their fantastic sound.

If your looking for classic metallica you wont find any of it here. The drums sound like lars is just pounding on pots and pans. And there is not a single guitar solo throught the whole cd. I personally feel sorry for those of you who've wasted your money on the summer sanitarium. Rob Trujillo should get out of this band cause hes the only one who still knows how to make good music. Dont waste your money on this piece of [junk]. If you do want to hear true metal go purchase a manowar cd or Dream Theater or best yet Black Label Society. I guantee you theres bands wont sell out like metallica did!",

When viewing the film it was assumed by the film makers that everyone watching already knew all the facts and event's in Ali's life thus the film would jump from one month to one much later, and even years later skipping over explanation for signifigant events.Anyone who know's Ali's life story already might find this much more appealing, however with out the background knowledge the film becomes hard to follow and rather confusing. With out this knowledge it becomes hard to even like this film at all. Even with actual effort put behind trying to like it.",

His attempt to get answers is impeded by the terrible sickness that seems to take over the situation.It is a touching story about parent child relationship. It is also a story about grief and the fact that sometimes we would rather have our parents around so we can hate them then loose them to death and life long sorrow for not being able to have them around ourselves except in our memories.Wonderful cast of very fine British actors.

I know this because every time I've played it, it's taken only that long--and I certainly don't mean that my friends and I were just so smart that we got through it quickly, I mean that it's just a very, very quick game. A game this quick is just not that fun to play. Some of the questions are moderate to difficult, but the vast majority have really obvious, simple answers that don't challenge the players. Easy, dull questions combined with a laughably short playing time mean that this game will not be taken off my shelf very often, if ever again.

The movie is hardly energetic, but does try to remain faithful to the original, including some awful dialogue, but also including the courageous theme of interracial love and marriage. Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi are adequate but lackluster in the principal parts. The use of color filters to underscore the musical numbers gradually becomes annoying, and doesn't add anything to the presentation. This is still a great movie to have, especially if you're a musical buff. The biggest disappointment (for the DVD version) was the second-rate video quality that seems to be present on all of Fox's classic R&H musicals, like \"The King & I\" and \"Oklahoma\".

I am impressed by: a) ease of installation with Windows XP; b) speed of printing text and graphics; and c) separate ink cartridges for every color. This is definitely a money saving feature, as one does not have to discard the whole cartridge because one of the colors is gone. In addition, printer does do justice to pictures (after all, it is a photo printer...). If I compare it to my old Epson Stylus Photo 875 DCS, I see about 50% better output by Canon. Overall, 5 stars for good quality machine, 5 stars for ease of installation.",

Wynton Marsalis is without a doubt the best trumpet player on the face of this planet, and that is not going to change any time soon. Quite frankly, this debut classical recording by Marsalis is also his best (and Grammy Award winning to boot). I don't begrudge Mr. Meuller for thinking another player or performance better, but to say that *many* trumpet *students* play these works better is an outrageous statement, and I hope other prospective buyers do not take such unfair and inacurate remarks to heart.For my part, this CD has been in my collection for years (actually, I have had to replace it several times due to wearing the CDs out), and it will remain so.

The DSC-P10 is a much better camera even though it is much older than the S500 and even though they both have a Sony lens, not a Carl Zeiss. Don't buy the S series. Since the P series and the V series are no longer available, go for the W series; the W30 is cheap and very good.",

Songs like \"It's My Life\" and \"The Next 100 Years\" are proof the Bon Jovi still has what it takes to be one of, or in my opinion the best band, in the world. Jon Bon Jovi's voice is classic, and Richie Sambora guitar riffs are amazing. They cover all genres of music on this album, and do it very well. The lyrics to Bon Jovi's songs are, as always, very inspiring and meaningful. This isn't boyband fluff. Songs like \"Thank You\", a beautiful ballad, and \"Older\" show that these songs have substance. They actually mean something, and make you feel something. Die hard fans, and even those who are not, will appreciate the songs, and you'll be singing them on your drive to work, trust me. You will not be disappointed in getting this cd. Bon Jovi is back, but in my estimation, they never left.",

He appears in the first chapter but he makes a big impression. Somewhere along the lines of $25,000 worth! Kinsey is supposed to deliver the money to a young man but that proves pretty difficult because the young man doesn't want the money and a lot of other people do.I liked this one the best so far. The ending was an absolute stunner for me. I never saw it coming! (Doesn't that make for the best mysteries?) I really like the character of Kinsey. At first her demeanor was off putting--she's so emotionless and clinical and dry. Of course, those are also the qualities that make for such a good detective. Needless to say, I'm in this for the long haul and can't wait to see what Kinsey comes up with next.",

I dare you to find a track that doesn't work. Great album. Great job, guys!",

However, I do not remember any significant racism at all and didn't know what the \"N\" word meant until junior high. Odessa has changed dramatically since 1988 - the economy is much better, has more diversity, and has more stability than it used to; more businesses and corporations are coming to Odessa; our schools are much better academically; and our medical facilities are now some of the best in the state. Football also has a different place now. The Panthers have not been to the state playoffs since 1998 and have not had a winning season since then - in '99 they went 4-6 and in '00, '01, and '02 they went 5-5. This has been a mixed blessing because it has allowed other sports and also the fine arts to receive proper recognition.

Instead, having one wheel in rear leats kids learn how to position their feet to scoot. That was excellent advice. This was the only one I found in that configuration, and I haven't always had good experiences with Radio Flyer products, but this one has been great. The height was right fromt the get-go. The base is nice and wide so my daughter doesn't have to struggle with balancing her feet. It is sturdy, not too heavy and not too light, so she doesn't go flying, but gets enough speed to be happy.

When traversing to toward the west, a large black dome with a golden starburst covered the same lower part of the sky. When the time rate was accelerated, the moon appeared as a 'ghost' image and extended from the horizon to overhead and covered a full 90 degrees of the sky.I removed it from my comuter and re-installed it an additional four times.

As soon as I got it I began to suspect it was not very high quality, just by the feel of it. Unfortunately, I was right. In weeks, the plastic covering began to separate from where it connected to the plug and just a short while later the wires under their second coating of plastic became exposed, shocking me when I tried to pull it out of the socket. Further, although technology experts at my school assured me this was the same type as what I had before after reading the description posted online, it is definitely not the same strength and I watched my battery which used to last well over 1.5 hours get to the point where it would hardly last me 40 minutes--not something I wanted for my computer-heavy classes. I would recommend paying the extra money and getting a quality product.",

Every year or so I willingly accept that trade off.Prey deals with the cross section of biological evolution and the computer age. Crichton does a great job of feeding the reader hard to digest scientific/ technical facts in format that is easy to understand (I think?). As always, the plot is futuristic and told in a \"this could happen \" style. It is a page turner and a compelling read. There is a real JURASSIC PARK feel to the structure of the novel, the character quality and behavior. It's only missing the dinosaurs.I do not rate this amoung Mr. Crichton's best but it was a good read for a cold winter's night.",

He explains different methods and then proceeds to elaborate on them. The book is packed with helpful tips. Each chapter includes true stories and potential situations. In addition to the book being extremely helpful, the book was hilarious. The author slips in humor and wit with ease. The book was a very enjoyable read rather than what could have been very boringly elaborated on.The section about employees at booths was especially helpful to me.

The Survey Service keeps an eye on pre-technological civilizations, with a strict hands-off policy, but a member of one team takes pity on the personable ruler of a Sumer-like culture and gives her something to cure her cancer. Unfortunately, when the next survey team comes back 1,500 years later, they find the queen is still alive and her kingdom is far ahead of where it reasonably ought to be. The Survey Service has political enemies who would like to see it shut down, and this is all the ammo they would need. And at that point, this turns into a lightweight version of a John Grisham chase story, with a bloodyminded bureaucrat committing mass murder to protect her budget. Speaking as a professional semi-bureaucrat myself, the author is way over the top on this one. I didn't find it believable at all, not even on its own terms.",

Honig plays like he's heavily burdened by something...no excitement to these ears, and nerves could have been the issue. The real disappointment is the drummer who plays so heavy-handed without complimentary dynamics, no bounce, like he was having lots of trouble following the charts and dared not add anything at all to the pieces. Maybe nerves also contributed to his conservative approach. I wonder if Mendoza in this context would have a choice in contracting the musicians?Anything with Vince arranging, though, is worth a listen, so 2 stars for him and the nice mastering.",

Some of my glue joints have been spotty at best and the average board height has been off considerably. With the Delta, I can get perfect joints and uniform height on all my rails. Now I am moving into full sized maple countertops. The 22-565 chews 6/4 maple and spits out a perfectly smooth 1 3/8\" X 2\" X 60\" rail with no problems. Snipe is no problem at all and the depth guide was right on. Assembly was basic and straight forward. Dad and I unpacked that planer and were using it within an hour.As a side note, as stated before, buy adequate hearing protection. When planing wide maple or other hard wood, it is deafening.",

Definetly a lot gorier than you're average killer snowman movie.PROS:we see more of Jack Frost, more gore, more nudity, lots of black humor, bigger budget, fast pacedCONS:crappy CGI snowballs, bad special effects(that might be a pro...)",

Married to an academic, and dissatisfied with being a housewife she attempts to fill her time by reading to residents at a retirement home. Her husband becomes very interested in the individual that Caroline is reading to, and steals a manuscript to further his research.The cynical disrespect and disregard that Caroline, her husband, and all the characters exhibit for ethics or pretense of social feeling is no doubt intended to amuse. Since her best friend is a hedgehog-fancier one cannot help but imagine that this is supposed to be a comedic story. Perhaps it is the distance in time (the book was published posthumously in 1986), but rather than humorous the characters are repellent, the plot depressing, the racism irritating.

What makes the characters interesting is how they grow and evolve and realize mistakes they have made in the past. The secondary characters were even more fun than the primary ones; I especially liked the relationship between Eleanor and the duke.The ending is very satisfying, with all the characters assembled train wreck style for the dramatic conclusion.

It's an incredible song that beautifully frames the hell that the characters are going through.While the soundtrack seems a little cobbled together (and the non-Aimee songs are basically throw-aways), it still fits the mood of the movie quite well. It is a great introduction to Aimee Mann, but she is better appreciated in true album form, such as with her new CD, Bachelor No. 2.

I had forgotten just how it takes your breath away. This CD contains a few songs that were popular on the radio a while back, and those are timeless. But \"I Love You\", a hauntingly enchanting song, is one of my favorites. Sung almost entirely in a breathless whisper, it really touches the soul. Not only is Sarah's voice a wonder to listen to, but the words in each song touch a chord somewhere deep inside. She is a master poet, and this comes through in every one of her songs. Because I enjoyed this CD today so much, I ran out and bought one of her former albums. But \"Surfacing\" is definitely worth the price, considering the emotions that spill forth from it.",

The first track, \"Twighlight\" is possibly one of the best melodic death metal songs ever written. \"Blood Colored\" could be considered as death rock and roll, and Swano started experimenting with clean vocals more on \"Black Tears\", not to mention it has one of the best/catchy riffs ever. \"Elegy\" has great lyrics, and \"Of Darksome Origin\" is just great, very evil. In short, this album is sweet, do yourself a favor, if you're into melodic DM, heard previous Swano efforts, you can't miss with Purgatory Afterglow. It's one of the best Swedish Melodic Death Metal 'representatives' in the field. Buy it.",

There is little purpose to his references.He also likes to use crass, and unnecessary puns like the character named \"Jack Schitt\" or \"Thursday Next\" the main character in the series. Obvious puns like this hurt his overall cause to make genre fiction intelligent and viable.

I love not having to smell stinky trash when I come home or to open and close a lid when I have food covered hands. The ONLY downside is the lid opening is a bit smaller than i'd like it to be so I have to break larger items down a bit, and if I walk to close to it, my arm gets within sensor range and it will open, but that's only due to the placement in my kitchen, not the product itself.

I enjoyed the mystery aspect in the early part, as the Enterprise crew slowly uncovered who/what was behind it all. The only thing that I didn't like was how the aliens ate people's brains- yeech! This left me with an uneasy discomfort. However, I rationalized that when encountering new races in such a huge galaxy, anything is possible. Not for the squeemish though. This was the only reason that I did not give it a 5th star. Otherwise, it is a good read for people who wish for more classic Trek adventures. Sometimes Star Trek writers do not handle love interests very well. However, McCoy's memory loss helped make this one work for me. I recommend this one.",

Now, I have the opposite viewpoint. Does that make me a hypocrite?

It is actually very neat and clean - no drips anywhere, even on the hot-plate.The one drawback is: It is SO SLOW. For 8-10 cups, it takes at least 45 minutes to brew the coffee.

Best of all, the auto turn off isn't too quick, giving me enough time to make my coffee pour overs.For coffee fans, this is a decent entry level scale. I will add a few negatives is that it is all plastic, so it feels a bit flimsy. I'd suggest for this price range maybe to find a metal one, but for at home use it works great. As a travel scale it would work awesome too because its so light. Overall, good product for coffee makers.",

Strange, but for those who bought these \"rollers\", there was never a chance to sell at the high...This book is full of wishful thinking, no matter how eloquent it sounds.",

Well, Pocahontas dispelled that myth. While this 10th anniversary edition was carefully put together, it does not hide the fact that at its core is a severely flawed and uninspired movie. The movie's slow pace makes it somewhat difficult to watch despite the brilliant colors and awesome sound. Disney fans are used to action and adventure appearing at expected and unexpected moments. And there's always a love story somehwere. Pocahontas, however, is almost devoid of any action and really does not have a love story. For that matter, there isn't much of any kind of story. I am sure that Pocahontas, a legendary figure in our history, deserved a much better treatment that this hauntingly weak Disney dud.",

There is so much in the way of back story that was crying out to be told. A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had. I'll just have to live with not knowing the preacher's story, or the many other questions not answered.

So before you buy i'd suggest you buy a pair of individual DVD's just to make sure they will work on your burner. I'll guess i'll try the HP DVD+R 4X that are priced very similar.

The worst thing about the unit is that it does not capture as many of the insects as the traditional zapper units and requires the pheromone lure and sticky pad to be replaced at least twice a year. Replacement sticky pads are harder to come by as many of the vendors selling the unit do not sell the refills needed later.

We couldn't be more thrilled with the purchase and haven't regretted it for one second. I hadn't been pleased with the hyper-brilliance of the colors on most plasma tvs I'd seen -- they were just TOO garish and bright and, in my opinion, lacked any relationship to reality. The picture on the Sony, however, is absolutely delicious. I can't imagine a picture being sharper and the colors are incredible. We haven't even hooked up the HDMI cable yet, but I can't imagine that the picture could get any better. This is a fabulous TV, and Amazon's price (right now) is by far the best around. Awesome!",

I used The Tudor Tailor almost exclusively to create a Henrician kirtle and fitted french gown, scaling up the patterns included in the book, which fortunately for me, required very little adjustment. I would recommend this book for someone with a reasonable amount of sewing experience, not because of a lack of instructions, but rather for the details involved in fitting and scaling of the pattern pieces. A set of good french curves also comes in handy. Things I would have liked to have seen were yardage recommendations for 60\" wide fabric and a few of the detail photos that were in black and white, larger and in colour.

They start to get ahead and then something makes them pause. Through all the trials, you watch as some grow into new gifts and others find out more of themselves, while some still find out more of others.

Unlike most remains that were buried in ash and subjected to extreme heat, these were somewhat protected by being enclosed in the cellar. This documentary explains the events that lead up to Pompeii's final days, how the people likely reacted, and what anthropology archeologists can determine from the well preserved remains found at the site. There is also a good deal of speculation and discussion on the \"intimate\" habits of the residence of Pompeii as remembered by history and depicted in the surviving frescoes.This will be worthwhile watching to anyone interested in Roman history!Recommended!CFH",

I would not even suggest wasting four dollars to rent it.I disliked the movie so much that I gave my copy away. Should have never purchased it in the first place. True fans of Tarantino and Ritchie will undoubtedly be equally disappointed.Would have taken stars away if possible.",

I have always had a soft spot for Pride and Prejudice, and LOVE the A&E version (and Colin Firth). The only thing I didn't like about this new movie is a few historical inaccuracies. These, however, are easily passed over and you can see how wonderful this movie really is. Both Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did an excellent job. I agree with someone who said in a previous post that they acted more along the lines with the ages of Elizabeth and Darcy. I really liked how they portrayed that sweet, soulful love that I understood Lizzie and Darcy to have. Also, that ending... what more could a P&P fan ask for? :)",

I had/have three issues with it but none are killers. First, because the roof/sunvisor in my car (a Mazda3) is low, when this is clipped to the visor you see it out of the corner of your eye and it is distracting. However, after a few days you get used to it and you no longer notice it. Second, sometimes on an incoming call it does not transfer automatically to the unit. When you then hit the answer button on the actual phone, it suddenly switches to the unit. Not sure why this happens, which is about 10% of the time. Third, as might be expected, the battery does not last as long as advertised. I find I need to charge it about once a week, and I do not use it heavily at all. However, all in all it does exactly what I need it to do, so I am pleased with the item.",

It kind of just stays there so you don't have this seamless look of just watercolor. It looks more like both watercolor and colored pencil together.

It's all VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL! Anyone wants to be in their shoes for a couple of hours.But what does it have to do with the moviemaking in the levels from Kent cigarette commercials and up? The movie too artificial to resemble the real life and to pass for a caper it's lacking that twinkle, the tongue in a cheek quality of the genre's masterpieces.It seems that most commercially successful James Bond wants to be taken seriously.

The item depicted is the \"Quake Kare\" space blanket, \"Made in U.S.A.\", with colorful packaging.Some of the reviews said that this type of space blanket was thicker and more durable than the others, so I ordered some. I received a clear plastic package with a small white label stating \"space blankets\" and the Amazon part number. No colorful label, no \"Quake Kare\", No \"Made in U.S.A.\".So, I contacted the seller and they said \"This is an item which we team up with Amazon to provide you. It actually ships from their warehouse although we are the seller. Because of this, we have to forward you to Amazon customer service to take care of the issue.\"No joy.

The story was rubbish but i found myself intrigued as to the final conclusions of the 'insights'.But is this book aimed at everyone?This is not start and finish spirituality. Anyone who judges it on this level is wrong to. And its not a book you would recommend for the plot. So whats it all about? My conclusion is that its a thinly disguised self help book, but lacks enough of the 'guidance' as to be of little use.Buy this book if you want some shallow amusement and some spiritual tickling but please dont embrace this book as the ultimate read.",

Instead of taking on important issues like racism and the Middle East, he settles scores with Black Panthers and allegedly anti-Semitism in the pro-Palestinian movement.

    "text": "Mickey Sabbath's life is one pathetic misadventure after another. An arthritic street performer, who once used his fingers as his puppets, he lives for his next sexual adventure. Any other ties to humanity, love, trust, honesty, (although he claims this value, he only uses it when it suits him) are lost amidst his pursuit of sexual gratification. Roth has deliberately created a character with no redeeming qualities, and while I admire his skill at developing such a reprehensible human being, I didn't enjoy reading about Mickey Sabbath or the lives he destroyed. No matter how many disastrous situations Roth creates for Sabbath I found myself wanting this to end; the book became a chore to read. Sabbath is a pathetic antihero, not an epic one, and hardly worth Roth's efforts on his behalf.",

Perhaps because of the poor dubbing, this was little better than the many \"spaghetti\" war films I have in my collection. While there appears to be a great effort on the producers' part to craft an epic war movie, there is an abysmal lack of contiuity and context. The technical aspects are pretty well executed, with proper uniforms and weapons. Also there are \"Tiger\" tank mock-ups based on T-34 chassis as seen in Kelly's Heroes. And those attacking planes(Sokos maybe?) do resemble FW 190s at first glance, all of which make this film all the more disappointing. Some great actors seem wasted, and even the legendary Bernard Herman was off his game with his uncharacteristically bland musical score. I'd like to see it remastered, and with proper subtitles so that the dialogue would be in the respective languages. Perhaps then this film will earn the \"epic\" description some have chosen to apply to it.",

Yes, Smith is trying to convey how different people of different backgrounds clash yet still try to get along, but for the reader's sake, it would have been nice to have a little more flow to the book. The book should have been titled _On Social Anxiety: When People Who Are Different Interact_, because that is its major theme. The thing is, we don't need a reminder of how different we all are.

I realize this is likely not the official soundtrack of the movie -- Disney wants to ensure the big bucks from the Christian community by putting out this \"inspired by\" crap. My fear is that it will scare away non-Christians who would otherwise enjoy the films. Let's leave it to the viewer (and listener) to interpret the subtext however they wish. C.S.

Based on my experience I would recommend looking for a pizza slicer with a large cutting wheel that is firmly attached to a solidly built handle.One more tip: when slicing pizza hold your pizza wheel at about 75-degree angle in relation to a table - your pie won't slide around then!",

Nestor Torres is a Puerto Rican native who relocated to Miami 25 years ago after studying in New York and Boston. He's one of those guys I'd like to like, but his music just doesn't do much for me. It's not lack of technique-he has plenty. His clean tone is straight out of the classical tradition, similar to fellow conservatory-trained jazzman Hubert Laws. While I prefer a grittier sound, I can enjoy such purity if the setting is right. But Torres' material leaves me flat; the pre-programmed arrangements he surrounds himself with are mechanical and boring. It's too bad. Torres says this album was inspired by 9/11 and by a lecture given by the Dalai Lama in Florida. I wish those events had sparked a more interesting musical response.Originally published in Port Folio Weekly, 4/11/06.copyright 2006 Port Folio Weekly. Used by Permission.",

I absolutely can't say enough about this novel and series as a whole. If you have any respect for the Star Wars legacy at all, please pass on this one. Pick up a copy of Zahn's trilogy and try to forget that any other Star Wars books were written.",

I'm giving this set a high score for durability because the pieces seem pretty indestructible and will probably get lost long before they break or wear out. But the cardboard playing board may need to be replaced or repaired (read: duct taped) after heavy use or rough handling. Kids will love that the pieces look just like the life-sized set Ron played in the first movie. And hey, in my opinion there just isn't a more educational toy than a chess set.

This antenna all I could get was three or four at a time. Took three or four positions to achieve all the channels that the cheaper one got with two positions.

You'll miss some of the more extensive character development of those out of the mainstream story such as Midas Mulligan, Hugh Akston, and Ellis Wyatt. The main characters have enough development to not appear as disjoint while the plot unfolds. I was impressed with the depiction of the John Galt line and the modernization of the background. For example, there is a plausible explanation why the rail continues to be important. For those who have not read the book, watch the movie then read the book. By then, perhaps the next one will be outand any remaining holes will be filled.",

Their great merit was not to sell out to MTV standards, and this fact alone made their fan base to stay loyal even after the horrible albuns they released in the nineties. With BRAVE NEW WORLD, thing were considerably better, but the presence of Janick Gers still in the band assured that some of the weakest parts of the bad albuns are still in the band, i.e. - lousy guitar solos by Janick.

We are living in a remote part of the world with no 911 service so this Angel Care is literally our Angel. (this and knowing infant CPR!) We sleep so much better knowing that if our son stops moving during his sleep, we won't sleep through it. It has woken us up twice, thankfully because he had scooched off of the pad. It was a huge comfort to know the Angel is so sensitive. The alarm does not wake my son enough to keep him awake all night either; he goes right back to sleep, if he wakes at all. We absolutely recommend this product to any worried moms and dads who reluctantly have to put their little one on their tummy to sleep. With all of the other things to worry about, some peaceful sleep is sooo appreciated!",

The two make a dangerous bet: Can Sebastion sleep with the headmaster's virginal daughter (Reese Witherspoon)before school starts in the fall? These roles are played expertly by the talented trio. Gellar, in particular, shines as the evil Katherine. She was awarded an MTV movie award for best female performance for her work here.

I find it astounding that Mr. Morris assumes that someone who has never run for public office and has always been appointed to positions, is nontheless the best qualified Republican candidate for the top political position. Whilst I realize it is a very appealing thought to Republicans to be able to break the stranglehold that the Democratic party has on the African-American voting block, I don't believe it is in anyone's best interest to promote any candidate without giving genuine analyses to the weaknesses of their candidacy.

Some just lay next to one another until the pieces on top of them get snapped in. So we have to keep pushing the pieces back together or else I have to hold them in place while he finds the other pieces to go on top. For example, none of the pieces in the whole bottom row of the train puzzle actually snaps together. I'm not sure why they were designed this way. It could be very frustrating for a kid to keep knocking these pieces out of alignment. The rest of the pieces fit together just like a regular jigsaw puzzle.

It is amazing that he had the stamina at that age to play so long and so well. There is nothing on the disc that long-time fans haven't heard before, but the glory of jazz is that every single performance is \"new\" and \"unique\" in some sense. My favorites here are \"Secret Love\" and \"Just in Time\" but actually, it is all good.

I know that is a bit of a nebulous criticism, but perhaps I can explain it better in another fashion. He writes page turners that do not read at all like a page turner. His vivid descriptions, and clever metaphors sound more like Jonathan Franzen than Thomas Harris. I like his Charlie Parker character and I plan to continue reading this talented writer. He is my wife's favorite author at the moment, and she thinks that all recovering alcoholics should read the series. She doesn't expect me to understand that statement until finishing book three, Killing Kind.

The mere fact that they refer to Down's Syndrome as Mongoloidism is offenseive. This book was written in 1985 and by then that term wasn't used anymore.Then there's the constant use of he, him, his, and mankind to refer to all humans male and female.There is some valuable information in this book, but not a lot.

Itmainly portrays New York's underground card rooms but also poker ina casino and in home games. It also shows the ugly side of losing andthe fun of winning.The story is a good one, though Hollywood, and stands on its own. Itgives the viewer enough to think about for life, not just at the cardtable. The main draw however (other than poker) is the acting.Edward Norton especially does a great job in creating an antihero whois likable but in the end is someone to avoid.I highly recommend the movie. Be warned that the language has plentyof profanity and poker terms unfamiliar to most.",

Of all the low ratings most seem to be unhappy with the DVD quality but finding the movie ok....As I saw it on cable I cannot comment on the DVD format but can safely say I found the movie boring, the acting uninspired and the plot far fetched and overly technical. You dont need to be 88 years old to be unable to relate to the way in which the plot is to be carried out... the main actors repeatedly admit they dont even themselves when presented to them.The movie is very slow paced and often outright boring and there is very few witty lines to cheer up us viewers.

I was a bit dissapointed that \"Blues Power\" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan. An ultra-supreme album, well-deserved to be a classic of its genre and era.",

I did have to upgrade my cable to Digital cable with the HDTV package and I got a Digital Video Recorder as well. So that was an expense that anyone that is going to upgrade to HDTV should consider. I didn't and it is not cheap, on the plus side it is well worth it for such a superior image and sound. the set itself performs well. It does need some calibration (Manual adjustment) and understand that it will never be perfect to everyone's eyes. Best buy has dropped the price and if you can get one for around $1500.00 you are way ahead of the HDTV game. I did buy the warranty for the price you pay for the TV it is just added security.

The first disc teaches nouns only and no verbs, adjectives, etc. Since it is fairly cheap, it is worth buying to go along with something else but just don't buy this expecting to learn a whole lot from it alone.",

After haggling with Toshiba for over a month Toshsiba only agreed to pay for 60% of the repair. First of all for the price of the TV, I should not have had a problem for years and second of all Toshiba should stand behind their product.

Finally the sugar wore off and she fell asleep - phew- that was so scary!! THE INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD SAY TO GIVE FERRETS ONLY ONE PER DAY!! PLEASE BE CAREFUL!! This product has a lot of sugar in it (it's the first ingredient listed!) and ferrets do not react well to that much sugar if more than one a day is given.",

I read a few reviews where the reviewers said that they got reception of over ten miles. I wonder who wrote those reviews? HHHHUMMMMM!

I tried a different route and still same result. I do not live in a canyon or in an area surrounded by skyscrapers. I live in an area where the houses are no more than two stories high and I could not get reception once I was more than ten blocks from my house. I am going back to my Motorla t-250's.

In fact, Lansky's writes a poem that parallels one of Seuss' classic works, but where Seuss is ever-elegant, Lansky comes across as down-right nasty. If dropping a baby on his head is your idea of cute, then these poems are for you. I would recommend something less insulting for the children in your life.

He concludes that civilization has removed the mystery from some megalithic sites and casually brushes off stone formations that leave him feeling empty. One wonders if the man or the megalith is at fault. If a site, such as Clava Cairns, does not cause an epiphany, or at least a sense of spritual feeling, he theorizes that the orginal constructors lacked creativity. Perhaps it is he who lacks the understanding of a deeper spirituality that withdraws when he approaches. When Dr. Peck explains away the sin of adultry as being his need to connect with God, I do not wonder that some sacred places cause him to feel empty..",

It's also one of the funniest and most charming of all the movies Chan and friends have done. The memorable characters are what have defined Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao as actors!

Now, these many years later, I have a greater appreciation for her portrayal here and I find that I am quite pleasantly surprised at her work. There is a subtle revelation of who Apple Annie really is that is quite beautiful to see. Her performance is so reserved that she seems to give the picture away to her co-stars, but what is actually happening is a remarkably intelligent development of character that only adds to Davis' range as an actor. She is, in a word, superb. All the actors are wonderfully cast in this truly delightful gem of a Capra film.

Turns out, she had literally devoured the WHOLE bone within a few minutes. I didn't particularly like that concept, mostly due to the potential choking hazard of a bone that crumbles that easily (she was 4 pounds at the time!).The rubbery bone did better than the bacon bone, but I ended up having to take the bone away because my pup would bite off shavings of the bone instead of eating it. This left quite a mess around my apartment, so that bone was pointless for us.The white bone has actually become her favorite bone over time. It doesn't make a mess, and now that she's a year old, she chews on it daily. So, if your pup doesn't like the white bone, hold on for a while and there's a chance that will change.I would not buy this set again, but I would be tempted to buy another of the white bones when this one runs out.",

This, along with providing context for the subject matter at hand, will make the paper that much stronger not only in its logos, but in its ethos and pathos as well.Especially appealing are the templates provided in each chapter. Like \"training wheels,\" they provide a perfect start for writers hoping to show some rhetorical flair.

Add to that the fact that she knows how to truly sing, not just exhibit her vocal skills (something Monheit desperately needs to learn). Kent makes each song her own, yet does it in such a way that the song retains its identity. There's not a weak link on this CD, but for me, \"Hushabye Mountain\" stands out as a showcase of Kent's ability to breathe emotion into a song. Be warned, however: if you're one of those people who think Krall's \"The Look of Love\" is \"boring\" because \"all the songs sound the same\" (i.e. because there's no \"Hit That Jive Jack\") then this album may be a bit above your musical appreciation skills.",

The acting and directing was wonderful. The film has a \"low budget\" feeling like the lives it's charaters lived. The dialog was quick, witty, and real. The actor who played Phil was great. He was able to hold his own with Gena Rowlands and that says a lot!!! Toward the end, I was rooting for Gloria to shot someone else (sorry to say!!).

The surfing scenes are classicly fake and amusing. There are flashbacks and twists and turns as we explore the stories of the serial murder suspects. There is also a \"Wizard of Oz\" like ending that makes one wonder if the story was really all just a dream.

He travels the world, tries out tips, teachers, and theories, with--I'll just say--moderate success.This isn't an instructional book; it's an autobiographical story. Nevertheless it speaks to the heart of the golfer who is wondering why, despite earnest intent and enormous effort, his golf game isn't improving perceptibly.Did Eisenberg break eighty? You'll just have to read to find out. One other thing you'll find out as you turn the pages is that he had an interesting journey, and that is perhaps the more important point.",

If \"...Godot\" is not the best play ever written, then it is certainly one of the top ten. A recently viewed video production (from Netflix) showed that the play can be produced to yield a range between its comic and tragic tendencies, when compared to the Roundabout version. This is not surprising, but it created a need to read the text, which is a translation from the original French. For me, the Roundabout production was the most illuminating, but the text of the play yielded insights that can come only from seeing words arranged on a page. Read the play and see it in many productions (live and video), in any order, and allow yourself to laugh out loud as your heart breaks.",

The statement that the ravine served to give an \"ideal defensive position\" can only be the result of lack of careful reading about Cleburne's conduct of the defense and ignorance about the terrain in question. Cleburne in fact set up his defensive line at least 500 yards south of the ravine and near the top of a gentle slope almost at the far end of Tunnel Hill.",

The book does a great job of helping an entrepreneur avoid many of those mistakes, and more importantly how to get the most out of your talents and realize your dream.The book does not cover the traditional areas of business (marketing, finance, accounting) but rather deals with what it is that seperates successful people from the rest.

She sings the lyrics with clarity and with proper amount of emotion. The album is really well put together. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that it didn't have enough ballads. The ballads really are the best songs. Just compare these ballads to those on her first album, and you can see how her voice has gotten so pure.

The units are pretty heavy then add shoes and I think it would be a wall disaster waiting to happen. They are working well stacked on top of one another.

The first reaction it would have to a print job would be the red light, indicating a jam. No jam. 5 minutes later, after repeating the above-described routine of opening and closing its compartments, it begins to print.The quality on it was very poor, and the moving parts inside are flimsy and poorly designed.I would NOT recommend you buy it. I plan to replace it with the same HP I use at work.",

They're valid literary devices. But an anti-hero always manages to have at least one redeeming characteristic, and Covenant has none.Save yourself the waste of time. Go read some Eddings, Duane or Stasheff instead.",

If ever a film director needed a good editor, it's Russell. But in GOTHIC, we only get the self-indulgence. Though I'm genuinely interested in the film's subject matter, I had to constantly suppress the urge to fast-forward. To borrow the line once used about Poulenc, Ken Russell had absolutely nothing to say about this subject...and he said it. [The film HAUNTED SUMMER covers the same territory with more intelligence, but it has it's weaknesses too. The relationships depicted in this film cry out for a serious film treatment, but it will take an awfully good screenwriter to liberate them from their literary roots.]",

That might still be moderately helpful if the portable XM really worked well. Instead, you have to work into just the right position, like a sad, contorted scarecrow, in order to get a passable signal. Here I am, wired like a demented robot with an earphone cord as well as (another thing they hesitate to mention) antenna cord pinned to me, and if I move (Lord forbid that you move with the music), the signal cracks and disappears.This product was introduced long before XM had the technology to support it.

Using the classic storyline of The Silmarillion y J.R.R. Tolkein this album captures and conveys the story perfectly. From the melodic acoustic \"ballad\" of a sort, Nightfll, to the metal riffs of the Curse of Feanor, to the utter sorrow and misery of Noldor (dead winter reigns) Andre Obrich's and Magnus Siepen's guitar work is as breathtaking as ever and Hansi Kursch's vocals continue to prove him the best vocalist in metal. Fans of Metallica, Testament, Iced Earth, Helloween, etc. will love this album. Just give it some patience.",

If you like slick, shiny synthesized perfection with very little excitement or vibe, this disc is for you. For me it was a big letdown.",

I dislike how Tuttle uses romaji instead of hiragana and katakana, so I'll keep practicing with my White Rabbit flash cards. Also, they'd do well to clarify some ambiguous words. For example, for the character ^ä, the authors give the English word \"well.\" But there's no clue whether it's \"Johnny fell down the well,\" or \"Johnny plays guitar well.\"However, I cannot imagine going back and learning Kanji any other way.

It was a big hit all day until the water filled bottom burst that same evening all over the carpet (it holds more water than you would think). I did not want to repair the rip and add more water just to see if it would do it again, so filled it with beans (thinking I likewise did not want sand all over the house and beans would be the least of the three evils).

At six hours in length, you can sure it goes into some great detail, but that's what I love so much about this version. This is history done true to form, and does not represent Jesus romantically or epically.I highly recommend this version of Christ's story over all others!",

The actual sets they do use are used over and over again, you get a feeling the city is three blocks by three blocks.While the first fighting scenes were good, the same things just kept happening and happening. Great, she walked into the middle of a circle of enemies. Over and over and over.That isn't even the real detractor, the acting sucked!

It should be noted that range and sound quality degrade rapidly as the battery wears down so it is neccessary to operate the unit with a minimum of a quarter charge left. All-in-all satisfactory and a great deal for the price.",

She comes with a blue jumpsuit, black boots, a magnetic collar, a hair accessory, a belt thingie, a cape, a blue shirt, a blue skirt, blue boots, a trading card, a hairbrush, a DVD, a purple duck, an egg, a purse, and a bracelet for you to wear.She has the prettiest bracelet of all the Winx Club dolls! The duck is not her pet. The fairies sent it to her and it bothers her all the time.They need to make Darcy and Stormy dolls, too! I would buy them! I would buy Tokyo Mew Mew dolls, too! Even if it was Mew Mew Power instead! (They ruined their names in that show.)I would definitley recommend any of the Winx Club toys!",

The performances are technically defective and interpretative-wise appalling. I don't think there's actually any redeeming features in this recording.",

I had been on the most powerful prescription steroids for both my sinuses and lungs, as well as, prescription antihistamines to address the root cause of my serious asthma condition -- POST NASAL DRIP (PND). Sinus Relief is the only remedy that lists PND as a symptom. Read the fine print in your allergy med insert -- you won't find PND as a symptom that it is designed to treat. And, it has been THE ONLY remedy that instantly stops the pesky dripping and clears my nasal congestion. Both my sinus issues and asthma have dramatically improved. I have since recommended this product to over 20 friends and family members with a 100% success rate! What can I say. . TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.",
